     <h1>Ethical Management</h1>
     <p>DLF believe that a strong and robust foundation of ethics and responsibility is absolutely necessary to sustain economic value. 
    With its legacy of fair, transparent and ethical governance practices, the Companyâ€™s Code of Business Conduct reinforces our commitment 
    to operate with the highest degree of integrity. It lays a framework for expected standards of ethical conduct and behaviour, extending 
    to employees and other individuals working with the Company. </p>
